I got my first apprenticeship opportunity. This post is a brief up about how I got into this and what is my experience so far. Let's start from the beginning :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Prologue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was in the last semester of my undergraduation and the placement offers that I had were not actually what I always wanted. And it wasn't everything about money, it was more about that I wanted to be a part of a company that practices all those updated development standards and tools that I have been learning since past years as part of my open source contributions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, here I was. At the end of the course and searching for a company that meets my need. I was ready to join as an intern as I did understand that I don't have enough hands on practice in Backend development that I could land in a company at a full-time dev directly. In this search, &lt;a href="https://fueled.com"&gt;Fueled Technologies Pvt. Ltd.&lt;/a&gt; was already on my list as I knew about the company from a project that I had contributed to on GitHub and I also attended open source meetups in their office around 2 years back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The application&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I went on to see their job listing. I was more than glad to see the open position for a backend apprentice! Hurray! It was exactly what I wished for. But I didn't applied for the post then and there itself. As we were shifting our place and I wanted to apply in peace and with preparations. So within a week when things were smooth on my side, I updated my resume and personal website content and applied from their website directly (without any intermediate platform like linkedin, etc).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The application experience was staightforward and simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The response&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I applied it was notified that we'll get back to you within 3 working days. But it was more than 1 week and I had almost lost my hope. I think after 2 weeks I got an email from Fueled stating that they would like to talk with me first on a phone call. It was like a usual phone call screening. And that was surprising for me to know. Because I wasn't expecting the response anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the application ride had been started and a lot more twists and turns were about to come that I couldn't forsee then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The process&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process was very refined starting with the application fillup that included uploading my resume, CV, and techs that I feel comfortable working with. Then the phone call screening was intended to understand that how much the candidate is serious about joining the company, etc. This was followed by a technical interview that included questions which were more focussed on concepts and foundational knowledge, rather than giving complex coding answers related to DS and Algo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was glad that the interview was not like those typical technical interview where we are given questions to solve to check our DS and Algo skills. Instead, the idea was to analyze weather the candidate likes software development, how much experience it has as a student, does it has foundational knowledge and a will to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first technical interview was taken by a Sr. Backend Engineer and a Lead Backend Engineer. After this, a second technical interview was scheduled with the Director of web engineering. When the date arrived, due to some reasons it was skipped and I got forwared to the last interview with their Lead Talent Acquisition. This went also great! Questions were mainly related to weather I was expecting a joining offer from another company or weather I am currently working in a company (if any).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of this last interview, they informed me then and there itself that I got selected for the position and as my final exams were going on those days. We later discussed my joining date and compensation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Epilogue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I got selected, they sent me an official offer letter for signing the contract and informed me about the other formalities needed to get onboarded. So it went like, my final btech exams ended in October first week and I joined the company in the second week. Pretty smooth transition!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the entire selection process from application submission till date of joining was 7 weeks long. And this got merged with my final btech exams that made it more dramatic and thrilling for me. I enjoyed both the selection and the onboarding process!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The journey so far&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is now 3 months that I have been working here as an apprentice and already feeling a lot more confident in backend development and a lot more professional than before. I got to know how work is done in an organization, how to collaborate in a team, and dozens of other stuffs! I learned new technologies that I didn't work with before. And I read a lot of assigned material. I worked on a practice project to try out things that I learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a nut shell, I wanted to get a feel of working in an organization like Fueled and that got fulfilled. I wanted to enhance my Backend development skills that have been improved of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This job is very special for me as it is my first one! :) And secondly, it has everything that I ever wanted in my organization. Currently, my apprenticeship is going on remotely, let's see where this journey will led me to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you very very much to all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Catch up my introduction on the Fueled's website here: &lt;a href="https://fueled.com/team/shiva-saxena"&gt;Shiva Saxena&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Manage Passwords With KeePassXC</title><link href="https://geekyshacklebolt.github.io/blog/introducing-keepassxc-as-password-manager.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-03-01T15:30:00+05:30</published><updated>2020-03-01T15:30:00+05:30</updated><author><name>Shiva Saxena</name></author><id>tag:geekyshacklebolt.github.io,2020-03-01:/blog/introducing-keepassxc-as-password-manager.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In this world of internet and social accounts, it is impossible to survive without password managers (except if you use same password across all the platforms, but that sound risky!).

&lt;p&gt;In this world of internet and social accounts, it is impossible to survive without password managers (except if you use same password across all the platforms, but isn't that sound risky?). So if you haven't selected your password manager till now, then &lt;a href="https://keepassxc.org/"&gt;KeePassXC&lt;/a&gt; would be really handy to work with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is KeePassXC&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned on their website:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KeePassXC saves your passwords securely. When you double-click a URL in KeePassXC, it launches your default browser to that URL. With browser integration configured, KeePassXC automatically enters username/password credentials into web page fields. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's really a nice password manager and easy to use if you are a beginner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why a Password Manager?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Question should be, &lt;em&gt;Why not to use a password manager?&lt;/em&gt; Because, we all keep creating accounts on all the social and other webstites and remembering them for all the platforms is just not possible. Usernames, are not a big issue, because people can make them consistent across all the sites, but that shouldn't be the case with passwords.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, I recommended using &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/diceware/"&gt;Diceware&lt;/a&gt; to create strong, lengthy passphrases for improved security but as remembering a lot of such lengthy passwords is tedious. Therefore, I recommend &lt;a href="https://keepassxc.org/"&gt;KeePassXC&lt;/a&gt; or any other password manager to store passwords and &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/diceware/"&gt;Diceware&lt;/a&gt; as your password generator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any password manager you would like to use, will create an encrypted database and to sync your passwords across all your machines you can upload that database file over any cloudhosting platform such as &lt;a href="https://www.dropbox.com/"&gt;Dropbox&lt;/a&gt; as it is a secure cloud hosting platform and provide file revisions (versioning) or you may go with anyone of your choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you in the next post :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you a Vim user, and searching for some awesome tweaks that would make your text editing more efficient and delightful? If yes, then I would like to share with you &lt;a href="https://github.com/amix/vimrc"&gt;The Ultimate Vim Configuration&lt;/a&gt;. The tweaks are so awesome, that I couldn't resist myself from sharing it on the blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The detailed documentation of the repo is already well written, and if you are a vim user then you can also make some of your custom tweaks if you want. In this, you get the availability of so many plugins at one place, configured optimized, and ease of extendability of your custom tweaks. Along with it, the installation/uninstallation process doesn't take more than 1-2 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After installations, I included some of my custom configurations as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;set&lt;/span&gt; nu

map &amp;lt;C-m&amp;gt; :tabnext&amp;lt;cr&amp;gt;

&lt;span class="nb"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; g:ctrlp_prompt_mappings &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="se"&gt;\ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

colorscheme gruvbox
highlight Normal &lt;span class="nv"&gt;ctermbg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, it is working like a charm for me! You may try it yourself if you wish to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, I initiated my dotfiles setup. And still, it is not fully furshined. I'll keep updating it as per my requirements and this blog post is here to share the same. My dotfiles are available on &lt;a href="https://github.com/geekyshacklebolt/dotfiles"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;. In case, you don't know about dotfiles. Let me quickly wrap that up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What are dotfiles?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are actally configuration files of your systems, including all your tweaks that you did in your tools, all installed packages details, your specific customizations, etc. So, in case you change your machine or in case of hard-disk failures or in any case when you need to switch to other machine. Now running the installation of your dotfiles setup over the new machine will bring back all your configurations back. And that's the beauty of having a dotfiles setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Know more about dotfiles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read my detailed blog post on: &lt;a href="https://www.thegeekyway.com/what-are-dotfiles"&gt;What are Dotfiles?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can also get a lot of useful info. about dotfiles here: &lt;a href="https://github.com/webpro/awesome-dotfiles"&gt;Awesome-dotfiles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Switching machine is no more a headache when you have a working dotfiles setup, but make sure to keep updating your dotfiles repo with changes you do locally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting a new blog mostly considered with HOW-TOs, detailed descriptions, product reviews, project documentation, monetization, marketing, etc. That means, most of the time people misunderstand the real purpose of blogging. For all those who would like to know why they should start a blog, kindly refer to &lt;a href="https://summertraining.readthedocs.io/en/latest/blogging.html"&gt;Why Blogging?&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been blogging for a few years. My previous blog is &lt;a href="https://geekyshacklebolt.wordpress.com"&gt;A Habit of Learning&lt;/a&gt; that is on wordpress. And I also contributed some technical tutorials on &lt;a href="https://www.thegeekyway.com/author/geekyshacklebolt"&gt;TheGeekyWay.com&lt;/a&gt;. But this one is going to be different. This one with pelican would be my personal blog from now on. I'll be sharing here my experience, etc. And with this, I am thinking of keeping this post short :)&lt;/p&gt;
