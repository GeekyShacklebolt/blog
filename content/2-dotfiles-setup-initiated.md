Greetings!

Recently, I initiated my dotfiles setup. And still, it is not fully furshined. I'll keep updating it as per my requirements and this blog post is here to share the same. My dotfiles are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/geekyshacklebolt/dotfiles). In case, you don't know about dotfiles. Let me quickly wrap that up.

## What are dotfiles?
These are actally configuration files of your systems, including all your tweaks that you did in your tools, all installed packages details, your specific customizations, etc. So, in case you change your machine or in case of hard-disk failures or in any case when you need to switch to other machine. Now running the installation of your dotfiles setup over the new machine will bring back all your configurations back. And that's the beauty of having a dotfiles setup.
